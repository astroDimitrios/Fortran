! (Advanced.) Write a program that solves Laplace's Equation âˆ‡2=0 using a relaxation method. (If
! you are not fa miliar with relaxation methods, consult any element ary te xt on numerical methods.)
! a. Declare a two dimensional NxN array, where N is some reasonably large value (at least
!    100 x100). Declare a real variable dx=0.1 . Set column 1 to 100 and all other values to 0.
!    Use array and subarray operations for this purpose. Add a DO loop over I and J such that
!    A(I,J) = 0.25*(A(I,J 1) + A(I,J+1) + A(I 1,J) + A(I+1,J))
! b. Be sure to pay attention to the loop bounds (that is, do not try to access an element of the array
!    that is outside of its declared size).
! c. Add an outer loop that performs the inner loop repeatedly. Test whether for all elements of A,
!    the value at the end of the loop is the same as (to the limits of floating point precision) the value
!    at the beginning of the loop. If this is true, exit from the loop. ( Hint: you can introduce
!    another array.) Print the result to a file in row major order.
! d. Change the DO loop to a FORALL . Check that your result is the same as before

! If you have access to a software package th at can plot text files, such as Python with Matplotlib ,
! plot your solution to the Laplace eq uation. Bear in mind that such packages generally use the end of line
! marker to determine the end of a row, so you will have to use formatted output.
