Original task solution in ***ex1_2.f03***     

! 1. Write a program that declares a real array of some particular size (N),       
!    using a parameter statement.     
! 2. (Initialize the array to zero.)     
!    Initialize the array with values from 1 to N.    
! 3. Read in an integer variable from a file.     
! 4. Test that the value is no greater than the upper bound of the array.      
!    If it is, exit with an error message. If it is not, loop from 1 to the     
!    input value, setting the I th array element to the cosine of the loop variable      
!    (remember to cast appropriately).      
! 5. Print out every 3rd element of the array so constructed.
