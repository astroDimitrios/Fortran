# Exercises

## ex1
! Write a program that adds two integers together.    
! Be sure to use correct style (program name, no implicit typing, correct     
! declarations).       

## ex2
! Write a program that adds a real number to an integer.      
! Follow correct style and be sure to cast one of the numbers appropriately.

## ex3
! Write a program that declares three character variables.       
! Initialize two of them to any desired constant strings.      
! Concatenate those two and store the result into the third.

## ex4
! Write a program that declares some real and complex variables.       
! Initialize the complex variables. Store the real part of one      
! complex variable into a real variable and its imaginary part     
! into another real variable.       
! Add two complex variables and store the      
! result into another.      
! Multiply one complex variable by the conjugate of another.
