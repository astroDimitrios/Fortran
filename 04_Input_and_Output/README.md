## Exercises

### ex1

! Take any program from a previous exercise and change it to print its results.  
!  a. Use list directed output to print to a console.  
!  b. Use list directed output to print to a file. Remember to open the file appropriately.  
!  c. Use formatted output to print to a file.  
!  d. Use formatted output, print to a file, and add code for handling potential error conditions in the

### ex2

! Take one of your earlier programs that performs some mathematical operation on at least two scalars.  
! Change the program so that those numbers are input from a file, rather than being set in the program itself.  
!  a. Use list directed input from a file.  
!  b. Use formatted input from a file. Include instructions to handle error conditions.  
!  c. Use a namelist to input the values.
