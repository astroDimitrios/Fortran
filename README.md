## Notes

Notes and exercises adapted from:  
[SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING IN FORTRAN 2003](https://wiki.uiowa.edu/download/attachments/109785161/fortran-novella-holcomb.pdf): A tutorial Including Object-Oriented Programming  
by Katherine Holcomb

Everything in directories **12** and up are from sources other than Holcomb.

to supplment the Holcomb pdf. Jump to [Notes](./01_Notes/12_lrz_course.md).

[13 Doxygen](./13_Doxygen/): Contains two examples showing documentation creation using Doxygen. Jump to [Notes](./01_Notes/13_Doxygen.md).

[14 Coarrays](./14_Coarrays/): Contains an example from the Intel tutorial [Using Coarray Fortran](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/fortran-compiler/tutorial-coarray/18-0/overview.html). Jump to [Notes](./01_Notes/14_Coarrays.md).
