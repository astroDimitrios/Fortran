! Relativistic mechanics makes use of four vectors that are generalizations
! of vectors to four dimensional spacetime.
! They consist of a quantity that is a vector in three dimensional space
! (e.g. momentum) and a fourth quantity that is a scalar (e.g. energy).
! One way of handling four vectors in a program might be to
! make the lower bound zero; this would correspond to the
! ``scalar'' element.
! However, the zeroth element might have different properties from
! elements one through three; thus it might be desirable to
! create a derived type.
!
! Define a derived type for the energy momentum four vector,
! which contains the scalar three energy E
! plus a three dimensional vector ùëù‚Éó, which is the ordinary momentum.
! Make the momentum element allocatable.
