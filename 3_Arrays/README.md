# Exercises

## ex1
! Write a program that declares two real and one integer arrays, each of size ( 100,100).      
!   a.  Initialize one real array to all zeroes and the other to all threes.     
!       Initialize the integer array to all six.    
!       Add the integer array to the array whose elements take the value of three and store into the third array.    
!       Remember to cast appropriately.    
!   b.  Change your program to add an integer parameter initialized to 100.    
!       Change the declaration of the arrays so that their size is determined by this parameter.    

## ex2
! Write a program that declares three arrays, multiplies two of them and stores the result into the third.     
! The arrays may be of any appropriate size and initialized in any manner.

## ex3
! Write a program that finds the sum of a rank 3 array with the argument dim set to 2.
