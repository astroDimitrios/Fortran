# Notes

The notes for Chapter 9 Modules are [here](../1_Notes/6_1_Modules.md) in my notes.

# Exercises

## ex1

! Write a module that computes the mean and standard deviation     
! of the values in an input vector.    
! Only the return values should be public;    
! all internal variables should be declared private.    
! Use the module in a program.    

## ex2

! Write another module that computes the standard deviation    
! and the sample kurtosis of an input vector.    
! Write a program that uses both modules,   
! but loads the standard deviation function from this module    
! under a different name.    
! Compute the mean, standard deviation, and sample kurtosis    
! for a vector obtained using the random_number intrinsic.

## ex3

! Change one of the modules from the preceding exercise    
! so that the functions will accept either real or    
! double precision input values.

## ex4

! Write a module in which a type is defined consisting of    
! two reals and an array of undetermined size.    
! Define the + operator for this type.    
! Write a main program that uses the module,   
! creates two of this type, and adds them.
