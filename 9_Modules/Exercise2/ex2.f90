! Write another module that computes the standard deviation
! and the sample kurtosis of an input vector.
! Write a program that uses both modules,
! but loads the standard deviation function from this module
! under a different name.
! Compute the mean, standard deviation, and sample kurtosis
! for a vector obtained using the random_number intrinsic.
