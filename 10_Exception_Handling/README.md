Unclear whether it wants this in a function. Assumed not since this is not the best way to check for divide by zero.

! Write a function that computes ùë¶/ùë•    
! Your function should start with     
! use ieee_arithmetic   
! use ieee_features    
! Invoke the ieee_is_finite function to check for     
! division by zero and if it occurs, return y = -999,    
! otherwise return the quotient    
!    
! This is obviously a contrived Test your function with x equal    
! and not equal to zero. Remember that the name of the function    
! can be treated as any other floating point value and    
! can be an argument to the ieee_is_finite procedure.
