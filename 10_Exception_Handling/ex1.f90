! Write a function that computes ùë¶/ùë•
! Your function should start with
! use ieee_arithmetic
! use ieee_features
! Invoke the ieee_is_finite function to check for
! division by zero and if it occurs, return y = -999,
! otherwise return the quotient
!
! This is obviously a contrived Test your function with x equal
! and not equal to zero. Remember that the name of the function
! can be treated as any other floating point value and
! can be an argument to the ieee_is_finite procedure.
